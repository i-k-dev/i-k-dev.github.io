1. DEFINITIONS  
For the purposes of this License:  
1.1 " THE VAULT™ " refers collectively to every single file, image, line of code, block of text, color, pixel, CSS property, HTML tag, design layout, written sentence, paragraph, metadata, favicon, and any other creative output contained in this repository.  
1.2 "You" means any individual, group, company, government agency, artificial intelligence, machine learning system, bot, crawler, or other entity whether real, fictional, corporeal, incorporeal, or otherwise that accesses this repository in any form.  
1.3 "Use" means to view, copy, duplicate, modify, adapt, translate, reformat, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, fork, distribute, publish, sell, lease, rent, license, sublicense, perform, display, broadcast, or otherwise exploit THE VAULT™ in any way, including memorizing it and reproducing it from memory.  
1.4 "Look at" means to visually process THE VAULT™ with your eyes, camera, scanner, optical sensors, or other input devices. This definition does not imply any right to retain, reproduce, or otherwise make use of THE VAULT™ beyond the act of temporary viewing.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS  
No rights are granted. This is not an open license. There is no implied permission. Access to THE VAULT™ is provided solely for personal, non-commercial, passive viewing. You may not reuse THE VAULT™ for any reason without my express written consent. No, asking your AI chatbot friend to "rephrase it" is not consent.  
If you were expecting a section that would make THE VAULT™ "free to use" then this is where you will be disappointed. This is not that section. This is the exact opposite of that section.

3. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES  
Without limitation, you shall not:  
3.1 Copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on THE VAULT™.  
3.2 Distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, lend, share, upload, or otherwise make THE VAULT™ available to anyone else.  
3.3 Claim ownership of THE VAULT™ or present it as your own work in any medium, platform, or reality, whether physical, digital, augmented, or virtual.  
3.4 Fork this repository, clone it, or create any public or private version of it without my written consent.  
3.5 Remove or alter any copyright notices, license text, or authorship attributions contained in THE VAULT™.  
3.6 Train, fine-tune, test, or otherwise incorporate THE VAULT™ into any artificial intelligence system, large language model, neural network, or other machine learning process. This includes but is not limited to data scraping, crawling, automated harvesting, embedding, vectorizing, or any other form of ingesting THE VAULT™ into a system that produces or aids in the production of generated content.  
3.7 Use THE VAULT™ for any purpose that results in you making money, gaining followers, winning awards, receiving compliments, or otherwise benefiting from my work without my permission.  
3.8 Use THE VAULT™ in any context that is illegal, immoral, unethical, offensive, harmful, annoying, irritating, or simply in poor taste.

4. OWNERSHIP AND COPYRIGHT  
THE VAULT™ is and shall remain my sole and exclusive property. This includes all intellectual property rights, moral rights, and any other rights that exist now or may exist in the future.  
Viewing THE VAULT™ does not transfer ownership. It does not grant you rights. It does not make it yours. It does not make it public domain. It does not make it "free". It does not make it "fair use". It does not magically turn it into a resource you can train your AI with. This is not a loophole.

5. AI AND MACHINE LEARNING RESTRICTIONS  
You may not use THE VAULT™, in whole or in part, for the purposes of:  
5.1 Training any machine learning model, neural network, large language model, or other artificial intelligence system.  
5.2 Feeding, scraping, crawling, harvesting, ingesting, embedding, indexing, or otherwise incorporating THE VAULT™ into datasets used by AI systems.  
5.3 Using AI or automated systems to extract stylistic patterns, code structures, design principles, or any other derivative understanding from THE VAULT™.  
5.4 Generating works that mimic, imitate, or replicate THE VAULT™ in style, tone, content, or appearance using any AI system.  
These restrictions apply regardless of whether the AI system is public, private, commercial, non-commercial, open-source, closed-source, experimental, abandoned, or secretly operated in an underground bunker.

6. TERMINATION  
This agreement will automatically terminate if you violate any provision contained herein. Upon termination, you must immediately delete all copies of THE VAULT™ in your possession, whether physical, digital, quantum, or imaginary, and must erase it from all forms of storage including hard drives, SSDs, cloud storage, USB sticks, backup tapes, floppy disks, punch cards, and the memory of any AI model you may have illegally trained with it.  
I reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time for any reason, including but not limited to: I saw you do something suspicious, I had a bad feeling about you, or I simply decided I do not like the way you looked at THE VAULT™.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY  
THE VAULT™ is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. I make no guarantees about its fitness for a particular purpose, its accuracy, or whether it will bring you joy. I am not responsible for any damages, losses, lawsuits, emotional trauma, existential dread, or minor inconveniences resulting from your viewing or attempted use of THE VAULT™.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  
In no event shall I be liable to you or any third party for any special, incidental, indirect, consequential, or absurd damages arising from your access to or misuse of THE VAULT™. This includes but is not limited to paper cuts from printed copies, headaches from reading this license, or injuries sustained while running away from metaphorical dragons guarding THE VAULT™.

9. GOVERNING LAW  
This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of whichever jurisdiction most favors my ownership rights at the time of dispute. This may include my home country, my home state, or my living room.

10. APPLICABILITY REGARDLESS OF YEAR  
The copyright year displayed in this License, or anywhere else in this repository, is provided for informational and aesthetic purposes only.  
Regardless of the specific year shown, this License applies retroactively, presently, and prospectively to all time periods, including but not limited to future years, leap years, fiscal years, alternate timelines, simulated realities, and any temporal constructs that may arise until the eventual heat death of the universe, the collapse of spacetime, or the point at which intellectual property law ceases to exist.

11. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE  
Free Palestine.

12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT  
This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and me with respect to THE VAULT™. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, whether written, verbal, or telepathically communicated.  
By accessing this repository you affirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to the absurd length and detailed prohibitions contained in this License. If you do not agree, you must immediately leave, close this tab, and go find something else to look at.

**Trademark Disclaimer**  
The ™ symbol in THE VAULT™ is purely decorative and for intimidation purposes only. It is not actually registered as a trademark. It just looks cool.

**Final Note**  
Congratulations. You have reached the end of this license. This means you either care deeply about respecting intellectual property or you are procrastinating on something important. Either way, good job. Now go hydrate.
